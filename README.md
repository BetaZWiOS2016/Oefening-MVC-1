# Exercise-MVC-1

In this exercise you will focus on the principles of **dataSource** and **delegate**.

## Tips
1. A project is built by using the shortcut ⌘+B
2. A project can be run by using the shortcut ⌘+R

## Tasks
1. Make sure the project compiles.
2. The tasks can be found throughout the project as warnings. Find them, solve them and remove them when solved.
3. Add a second button that sorts the words in alphabetic order.
4. It's undesired to view the same blog post twice. Remember which have already been displayed and indicate this visually in the table (e.g. by chaning the background color of the row).
5. _Try to remove a row from the table when clicked._
6. _Try to add animation to the row removal._
7. _Try to add swipe-to-delete._

## Solutions
The solutions are available in the **oplossing** branch of this repository.
